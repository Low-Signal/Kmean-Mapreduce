# Kmean-Mapreduce
* Plotting of scikit-learn's "digit" dataset using kmeans algorithm and mapreduce.

* Instructions are located in venv/readme.md

* The two png files are the outputs of plotting regular kmeans and kmeans with mapreduce.
* Though these two figures are similar, some data points differ in label near the bounderies as they have been reduced to a "more average" center point.
