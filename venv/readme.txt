# KMeans Plotting
* Digits.py uses the k means algorithm on the digits dataset.

* The mapper can be ran to fill the labels and value text files.
* The dictLabel file stores all of the label values for each run of the mapper and must be empty to start a fresh test.
* The plotter.py file then plots the reduced values using the reducer.py file.
